To whom it may concern,

I am writing to report a phishing domain that is registered with your company.
The domain is [insert domain name], and the fraudulent website associated with
this domain is [insert website link].

I would appreciate it if you could take immediate action to investigate this
matter and suspend the domain registration. This will help to protect internet
users from falling victim to this scam.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
